## Explanation of the Solution | Write and Search for products in a file

## Solution:

- Zero function:
  1. Create a function with one variable to enter (the number of products to write to the file), which write the goods to a file.

  2. In the function:
    - Open the file.

    - Create a loop in which:

      1. Enter the name of the product, country and volume.

      2. Add three variables to the list.

      3. Convert a list to a string for writing to a file.

      4. Adding a line to the file.

    - Close the file.

    - Return the name of the file to which all are recorded for further action with it.

- Add a variable to which after starting the program will write the number of products to add to the file.

- We create another variable in which we call our function with the previous variable.

That's all.
