## Converting to a binary number

## Problem:

You enter a number that must be beaten whole. And the program turns it into a binary number.

## A task:

Print the line: "A binary number from n is b", where n is the number you enter, and b is the binary number that the program produces.

## Check:

> N is the number that is entered.

1. n = 3 -> "The binary number from n is 11"

2. n = 65 -> "The binary number from n is 1000001"

3. n = 0 -> "A binary number from 0 is 0"

4. n = -7 -> "A binary number from -5 is -"

## What's next ?

__The program does not come out or works not exactly__, go to the solution folder and look at the explanation for solving the problem, this will help you.

__If you have everything turned out__, you can go to the solution package and compare your solution with the one that's there.

> If your decision does not coincide with my decision, then I'm very happy for you. __Please share it with me, I will be very grateful to you and then I will add it to the solution folder__. How to add your solution, see here
