## Text without multiple spaces

## Problem:

There is a file with not formatted by our lines, that is, there is more than one space between words.

## Task:

Write a program that writes all the words from a file (with unformatted lines) to a file (in which there is one space between words).

__!Tip__, try this with the help of functions (this will teach you to break the program into small parts and use them several times without copying the code, in contrast to the linear programs)

## Data to verify:

Go to the data folder where you will find txt files to check

## What's next ?

__The program does not come out or works not exactly__, go to the solution folder and look at the explanation for solving the problem, this will help you.

__If you have everything turned out__, you can go to the solution package and compare your solution with the one that's there.

> If your decision does not coincide with my decision, then I'm very happy for you. __Please share it with me, I will be very grateful to you and then I will add it to the solution folder__. How to add your solution, see here
