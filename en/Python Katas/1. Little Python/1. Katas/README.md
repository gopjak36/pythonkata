## How many bobs are there?

## Problem:

There is _one one whole string in lower case, which consists of letters_. And in this line you need to find the number that is repeated __"bob"__.

__Note:__ If there is __"... bobobob ..."__ in the string, then it is considered as _bob has been occurs 3 times!_

## A task:

Display: _Bob occurs times: n_, where n is the number of times that "bob" occurs.

## Data to check:

> s - string to check

1. s = "babbobbobabrbb" -> Bob occurs times: 2

2. s = "boobobbobobdasdabbo" -> Bob occurs times: 3

3. s = "ogbobbobobozobobojbobobsobob" -> Bob occurs times: 7
