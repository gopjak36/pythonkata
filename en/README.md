## What is Python Katas?

__Python Katas__ is a repository with Python tasks, which I will call Python Kata.

All Katas, collected from all corners of the Internet, namely from the courses, tutorials, webinars that I passed

And now I want to do this not just to share with you, but to tell you how to come to the solution of problems.

There will be three levels available: __Liitle, Median and Guru Python__, but they are a bit later

### What I need to know for Python Katas?

1. Have basic knowledge with Python, in general and all. This is quite enough to start.

All the rest you will master in the process of solving Katas, because the Internet you will always be at hand and you can restore the gaps in the syntax of Python or something else, a little shamaniv with Google:)

> __Primary:__ I do not want to do the next Python course, where you are driven through the basic syntax and things that you can fully explore yourself. And I want to focus on more interesting assignments and parsing their solutions.

## Levels in Python Katas:

1. __Little Python__ - the level is calculated for beginners.

> At this level, I will write as detailed descriptions of the problem as possible, give a link to useful materials that will help in solving this problem.

2. __Median Python__ - is the level for those who used to deal with Python and now want to plunge into it even more.

> Here, in the description of the assignment itself, there are clues that you should use to solve the problem, to concentrate more on the problem.

3. __Python Guru__ - for those who are free to feel in Python.

> Check your strength ??

## How to add your Katas?

> If you have interesting Katas, then please add them.
